```python
User Log 
#We can use the word count function to keep track of how many times users log in. We could use “list.count”, “list.append”, “list.sort”, “list.index”, and “list.copy”, as data structure for this problem. We can also use these functions to see how many suspicious activities, or any system glitches are going on.
